# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Objective
To predict house prices using multiple numerical features such as bedrooms, bathrooms,
square footage, and construction year using Linear Regression.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 4600 records with 18 features including:
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- sqft_living
- sqft_lot
- floors
- waterfront
- view
- condition
- yr_built
- yr_renovated

Target variable: `price`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Model evaluation using MSE and R² score
6. Prediction and visualization

## 📈 Results
The Linear Regression model achieved a good R² score, indicating an effective relationship
between house features and price.

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be used for real-world house price
prediction problems.
